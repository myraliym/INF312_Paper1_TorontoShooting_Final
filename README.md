For Toronto residents, shootings are always one of the biggest concerns. After analysing data from 2012 to 2021, it is easy to see that the majority of shootings occur at evenings and nights. At the same time, neighbourhoods have a greater relationship with the probability of a shooting occurring. This paper attempts to visualise these findings. 
In this repository, you will find:
1. Inputs Here, you will fine the raw data (toronto_shootings.csv) that was used for this analysis, as well as the cleaned and filtered csv, called cleaned_toronto_shooting.csv, which were created in my analysis.
2.	Outputs There are the things that I created with the inputs. This includes
•	The reference file (references.bib)
•	The Pdf document (toronto_shooting_paper1.pdf)
•	The Rmd file with all the code used to produce visuals (toronto_shooting_paper1.qmd)
• The r file for testing (simulated_test.R)
3.	Scripts: Contains the R-Script with code that was used to clean the raw data.
4.	License for re usability.
5.	This README!
